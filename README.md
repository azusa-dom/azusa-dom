## 👩‍🔬 About Me

- 📍 Currently studying at University College London, Global Business School for Health (GBSH)
- 🧪 My dissertation:  
  **A Dual-Modality AI Framework for Ankylosing Spondylitis Diagnosis Under Real-World Data Constraints**  
  ↳ Independent pipelines for MRI and Clinical EHR data, validated on separate cohorts

## 💬 Research Interests

- 🧠 **Deep Learning in Healthcare**  
  Focused on modeling structured Electronic Health Records (EHR) and medical imaging (MRI, CT, Ultrasound), using architectures like Transformers, LSTM Autoencoders, and multimodal neural networks for clinical prediction tasks.

- 📉 **Small-Sample Learning in Rare Diseases**  
  Interested in few-shot learning, federated learning, and transfer learning for diagnostic tasks in rare diseases like Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), especially under real-world data constraints.

- 📊 **Decision Curve Analysis (DCA)**  
  Applying DCA to quantify clinical utility and net benefit of AI predictions under various decision thresholds. Used in optimizing Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS).

- 💉 **Biologic Therapy Timing & Effectiveness Prediction**  
  Exploring time-to-initiation and outcome forecasting of biologic treatments in immune-mediated diseases (IMIDs), using survival analysis and longitudinal EHR modeling to support personalized care.

- 🧰 Tools & Libraries:
  `PyTorch`, `Python`, `XGBoost`, `TreeAge Pro`, `Power BI`, `LaTeX`
- 👩‍💻 Past Work:
  - Medical Imaging Data Annotator at Qianlima Medical Tech (2024–)
  - HR Automation Intern at Baidu (Python scripting)
